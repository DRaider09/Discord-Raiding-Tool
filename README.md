# Discord-Raiding-Tool
This is a rework of Dead Breads Raid Toolbox. There was a lot of areas that I tried to improve, including ensuring that the online status feature kept the bots online in order to message spam properly. As usual, it's recommended to use proxies when running this raid tool. While it can work without them, Discord is more likely to ban the raid accounts. The raid tool includes a free proxy scraper so be sure to at least try and implement it before starting a raid on any Discord server.

## How to run
1. Download the Raider v3.0.exe file
2. Run the install
3. The Dead Bread Raid Toolbox GUI will appear and you should be good to go!

(Warning: May trigger antivirus similar to Dead Breads Tool)
