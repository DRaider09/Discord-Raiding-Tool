# Discord-Raiding-Tool
This is a rework of Dead Breads Raid Toolbox. There was a lot of areas that I tried to improve, including ensuring that the online status feature kept the bots online in order to message spam properly. 

## How to run
1. Download the Raider v3.0.exe file
2. Run the install
3. The Dead Bread Raid Toolbox GUI will appear and you should be good to go!
